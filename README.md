# SwedbankCore

A clone of [SwedbankSharp](https://github.com/LiljebergXYZ/SwedbankSharp), made to work with .NET Core 2.0.


It is currently using .NET Framework 4.6.1 to restore Microsoft.AspNet.WebApi since it is not yet compatible with .NET Core 2.0.
See: https://github.com/aspnet/Mvc/issues/5822.
